### Student
# Student has 10 properties

# Student properties are the fields in the /etc/passwd line, and its @count, @first_name, and @last_name properties



##### Course
# When a user clicks on a column name, redisplay the data sorted by that column

# add sorting by field name

# use Enumerable#sort_by to sort Student instances by attribute

# use the send method to accomplish sorting Student instances by attribute

# OPTIONAL: toggling sorting from ascending to descending

# Display the output using an ERB template named lab5_template.html.erb.
# use ERB template to create the HTML
# all of the HTML for the page should be in the ERB template
# no html should be in lab5.cgi

# know which column the user has selected

# use the CGI class to parse the user choice from the query

require 'cgi_helper'
include CGIHelper
require 'cgi'
http_header # print the Content-type line and blank line
@sort_by = CGI.new.params['sort_by'].to_s

# store the user selection in @sort_by

# sort the Student instances using the Enumerable#sort_by method.



#### CGI_Helper
# Create a module named CGI_Helper in a file named cgi_helper.rb

# determine the column to sort by
# use the CGI class to extract the value of the sort_by parameter

# CGI object will store the key value pairs in a Hash named "params"

# This module should contain method http_header # prints the 'Content-type: text/html' and a blank line.

# optional method: doctype(type) # returns a valid HTML DOCTYPE. See http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html for a complete list.



#### finally

# there are three files lab5.cgi, cgi_helper.rb, and lab5_template.html.erb

# UPLOAD TO HILLS

# combine all three files as lab5.cgi for upload to insight
